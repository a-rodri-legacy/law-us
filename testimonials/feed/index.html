										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much for all of your help on my case. I remember walking into your office for the first time terrified over the situation I had found myself in. Over the last year and a half you have educated me on a completely different side of education that I didn’t learn about while I was pursuing my degree as a teacher.</p>
<p>This case came to me as I was a brand new first year teacher, which quickly changed my perspective on all the things I thought I knew. I am very grateful I had your guidance along the way..</p>
<p>Thank you again Ann!</p>
