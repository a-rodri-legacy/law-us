										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Education is an important, influential calling.  Unfortunately, these days, it is also a juggling act with serious consequences for dropping a ball, whether that ball be ensuring student safety, handling special education paperwork, comporting with school financial policies, or improving student scores on standardized tests. </p>
<p>Teachers, paraprofessionals, and administrators can lose their jobs, their licenses, and sometimes even their freedom for a mistake in any of these areas, and so many others.  Attorney Ann Brumbaugh, the daughter of a teacher, has represented educators in employment, ethics, criminal, and DFCS cases since 2014.  Her vast experience, patience, and passionate advocacy has assisted hundreds of educators in the worst hours of their professional lives.</p>
<h2>Suspensions, Terminations, and Non-Renewals</h2>
<p>Have you received a Notice of Non-Renewal?  <br />
Must you choose between resignation and termination?<br />
Does your school system want to suspend you?  </p>
<p>These are issues Ann handles every day.  Ann will start with a consultation in her office where you will tell her your story.  We will consider the specifics of your situation, which includes how long you have worked, where you currently work, and any personal obligations outside of work that could impact your decision.  Ann will review all relevant documents and will explain to you the laws and policies that apply to your job (because, unfortunately, they vary from school system to school system).  We will discuss various strategies and the pros and cons for each one.  Once you have decided the right approach for you, Ann will execute upon that strategy.</p>
<p>If you decide that you want to resign or accept a suspension,</p>
<ul>
<li>Ann will negotiate the best possible outcome.</li>
<li>Ann will take steps to preserve your reputation as you seek future employment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to invoke your right to a hearing,</p>
<ul>
<li>Ann will aggressively defend you.</li>
<li>Ann will expose the weaknesses in the school system’s case and highlight the strengths in yours.</li>
<li>Ann will make sure that the school system follows the procedure and does not cut corners.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are facing any of these situations, please <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a>.</p>
<h2>Ethics Cases </h2>
<p>Has your school system informed you that they are reporting you to the Professional Standards Commission?<br />
Have you received a Notice of Investigation from the Professional Standards Commission?<br />
Have you received a letter from the Professional Standards Commission recommending that your certificate be reprimanded, suspended, or revoked?</p>
<p>These are serious legal issues for which skilled, experienced legal help is paramount.  Fortunately, Ann is one of the most experienced lawyers in Georgia with regards to the Professional Standards Commission.  As an Assistant Attorney General, Ann represented the Professional Standards Commission from 2005–2012, and has represented teachers, paraprofessionals, student teachers, and administrators before the Professional Standards Commission since 2014.</p>
<p>Ann conducts the same in-depth investigation into Professional Standards Commission cases as she does with employment discipline cases, listening to her clients and then fighting on their behalf.  As with employment discipline issues, many of Ann’s cases settle on very favorable terms which enable the educator to continue his or her career.  When the Professional Standards Commission is unwilling to compromise, Ann strenuously defends her clients at hearings held before Administrative Law Judges at the Office of State Administrative Hearings (OSAH). </p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.annbrumbaughlaw.com/practice-areas/administrative-law/">Administrative Law</a> page and the <a href="/faq/">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.  Both provide more information about Professional Standards Commission cases, particularly deadlines, which are crucial to follow.</p>
<h2>Other Employment and Certification Issues</h2>
<p>In addition to disciplinary issues, Ann represents teachers in many other areas, including certification upgrades, salary disputes, teacher evaluation appeals, and accommodations requests.  Ann speaks the language of educators fluently, such as with regards to TKES evaluations.  For example, if you tell her that you received a 15 on your Summative or a 2 in Differentiated Instruction, she will know exactly what you mean, what that means for your career, and what your legal options are.  She will then work with you to find the solution that best fits your needs.</p>
<p>Should the school system blatantly ignore the law, Ann will enforce your rights through the court system.  Though suing school systems for monetary damages is generally very difficult, Ann has successfully obtained orders from the Superior Courts of Georgia forcing school systems to do what the law requires. </p>
<h2>Criminal Allegations and Child Abuse Investigations by the Department of Family and Children’s Services (DFCS)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, teachers and paraprofessionals are sometimes forced to defend themselves from criminal charges or allegations from DFCS that they have committed child abuse or neglect.  As a former prosecutor, Ann can defend teachers and paraprofessionals from these charges as well.  Ann brings the same passionate advocacy to these cases as she does to employment and ethics cases.  Additionally, once the criminal case is resolved, Ann will try to get the records restricted and sealed on behalf of her clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you a county election board looking for independent legal counsel?  <br />
Are you involved in an election contest, a recount, or a challenge to a candidate’s qualifications to run for office?  <br />
Have you received a Notice from the State Election Board?<br />
Are you an attorney who needs a consultation on the Election Code?</p>
<p>Ann can help with all of these situations, and the many others that arise in the context of elections.  As an Assistant Attorney General, Ann represented the State Election Board from 2009–2012.  She then led a bi-partisan Election Code Review Committee at the behest of then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp from 2012–2014.  This experience gave Ann unparalleled familiarity with Georgia’s Election Code.  Since launching her own practice in 2014, Ann has represented or advised all of the types of clients previously listed:  county boards of election; political candidates; individuals; and other attorneys.  If you have a legal issue regarding an election, please <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a>.</p>
<h2>County Boards of Election</h2>
<p>Election law is a highly specialized area.  Many of the laws and rules are technical and few are intuitive.  They change every single year.  Especially during voting periods, issues come up very quickly and courts will often schedule expedited hearings to resolve them.  Ann’s experience enables her to provide fast, accurate, and well-informed advice and representation.</p>
<p>Further, conflicts arise between Boards of Election and County Commissions, meaning that the general county attorney cannot represent the Board of Election.  If you are a member of a Board of Election and think your Board should retain independent legal counsel, Ann is available to help.</p>
<h2>Candidates</h2>
<h3>Election contests and recounts</h3>
<p>As with county boards of election, political candidates often find themselves in the midst of emergency litigation.  Often this litigation takes the form of an election contest, in which a voter or a losing candidate challenges the validity of the winning candidate’s victory.  Challengers must follow a very specific set of notice and timing requirements with which few lawyers are familiar.  In an election contest between opponents in a primary, the contest must be resolved before the general election or the contest becomes moot. </p>
<p>Ann’s expertise in this area enables her to either successfully frame or defend an election contest. The Supreme Court’s opinion in Dawkins-Haigler v. Anderson is proof of Ann’s knowledge, skill, and experience.</p>
<p>Candidates may also need legal counsel for recounts, which occur when the margin between the winning and losing candidate is very small.</p>
<p>Ann is available to assist you if you find yourself in either of these situations.</p>
<h3>Residency and other qualification challenges</h3>
<p>Candidates also occasionally face residency or other types of qualification challenges, including issues regarding taxes, criminal history, or specific experience in more specialized races such as District Attorney.  These also must be resolved quickly so that unqualified candidates do not appear on ballots.  Please <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a> if you have a concern about this type of issue.</p>
<h2>The State Election Board</h2>
<p>The State Election Board is a five-member body which is charged with considering violations of the Election Code and passing administrative election rules which supplement the Election Code.  It generally meets quarterly.  Like other state agencies, it both finds “probable cause” regarding whether a violation of the Election Code has occurred, and then later accepts or rejects proposed administrative resolutions of these Election Code violations.  Since many violations of the Election Code are also classified as crimes, the State Election Board may refer a case to the local District Attorney for criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>If an administrative violation of the Election Code is found or admitted, the State Election Board may order a violator to cease and desist; publicly reprimand the violator; or impose a civil penalty.  The State Election Board may not impose a civil penalty without giving the alleged violator an administrative hearing.   </p>
<p>Alleged violators can be voters, election officials, or candidates.  Types of violations that voters are often accused of include improperly submitting an absentee ballot, double voting, issues with registration, and inappropriate conduct with elections officials. </p>
<p>If you have received notice that you are being investigated for an election violation, please <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a> as soon as possible.  Because of the complexities of the Election Code, it is important to have an attorney familiar with its provisions guide you through the process. For more information, please review the duties of the <a href="https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/state_election_board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Election Board</a>.</p>
<h2>Consults</h2>
<p>If you are a county attorney, or an attorney who finds yourself handling an election case, Ann can provide consultative services.  These may include serving as an expert witness, writing an advisory memo, or simply answering questions on an as-needed basis.  Please <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a> if you would like to discuss the details of this type of arrangement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Administrative Law?</h2>
<p>Administrative law is a form of civil law in which a government agency seeks to punish an individual for breaking its laws or its rules.  Because it is not criminal law, the remedies cannot involve jail time.  An adverse decision will not appear on a criminal record.  Nonetheless, the outcomes are punitive, and can have a catastrophic effect on your future. </p>
<p>They are also specific to the agency.  So, if your child is accused of bringing a weapon to school, a school system will seek your child’s suspension from school.  If you are a doctor and you are accused of an inappropriate relationship with a patient, the Georgia Medical Board will advocate for the suspension or revocation of your medical license.  If you drive on the Peach Pass lanes without paying the tolls, the State Road and Tollway Authority will request a civil penalty.  All of these are different examples of administrative law.</p>
<h2>How Does Administrative Law Work?</h2>
<p>Each government agency may set up its own rules, but all agencies must provide basic due process before it can impose any punishment.  In the administrative law context, due process means notice and a hearing. </p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>“Notice” means that the person accused of violating the agency’s rules must receive enough information about what he or she is alleged to have done wrong in order to prepare a defense.  This generally means that the accused (or “respondent”) will receive a brief description of the allegations against him or her.  Depending on the agency’s rules, the notice can also include a list of witnesses, and a list of exhibits the agency expects to rely upon. </p>
<h3>Hearing</h3>
<p>“Hearing” means a trial before an administrative law judge or a hearing officer.  The most significant difference between what you see on TV and an administrative hearing is that there is no jury in an administrative hearing.  Otherwise, the hearings have all the regular components of a trial:  opening and closing statements, direct and cross-examinations of witnesses, introduction of evidence, objections, and the right of each party to an attorney.  The hearings are generally recorded, although the recording might be nothing more than a tape recorder.</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing the administrative law judge or hearing officer will issue a written decision which can be appealed.</p>
<h2>Examples of Administrative Law in Georgia</h2>
<h3>School Disciplinary Hearings</h3>
<p>School disciplinary hearings are held within the school systems by trained school personnel.  The school system must provide a notice of the charges and a list of witnesses to the student.  The hearing must be held within ten days of an out-of-school suspension, unless a continuance is granted.  A decision to suspend a student by the school board may be appealed to the State Board of Education, which publishes all of its decisions.  You can <a href="https://www.gadoe.org/External-Affairs-and-Policy/State-Board-of-Education/Pages/PEABoardDecisions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review the State Board’s decisions</a> online. </p>
<p>Since opening her own law practice in 2014, Ann has represented students at these hearings.  If your child is accused of violating the school system’s Student Code of Conduct, please <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a> to discuss your options.</p>
<h3>Office of Bar Admissions</h3>
<p>If you are a law school graduate applying for admission to the Georgia Bar, you must not only pass the Bar Examination but also have your character certified as fit.  If your application reveals evidence of dishonesty or bad character, the Board to Determine Bar Fitness may issue you a tentative denial.  You are entitled to a notice of the reasons for the denial and a hearing to contest the denial. </p>
<p>The hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, who issues a recommendation to the Board to Determine Bar Fitness.  As an Assistant Attorney General from 2005-2012, Ann represented the Board to Determine Bar Fitness and conducted several of these hearings on their behalf.  If the Board to Determine Bar Fitness has tentatively denied your application, <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a>.</p>
<h2>Professional Licenses and Civil Penalties:  The Office of State Administrative Hearings</h2>
<p>Most state agencies refer their administrative law cases to the <a href="https://osah.ga.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of State Administrative Hearings</a>, otherwise known as “OSAH.”  OSAH is an independent agency staffed with administrative law judges (“ALJs”) and clerks.  While the OSAH headquarters are in Atlanta, the ALJs travel around the state to conduct hearings.  The state agencies are generally represented by the Office of the Attorney General at these hearings. </p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>At OSAH, the Notice takes the form of a Notice of Hearing, which tells the respondent when and where the hearing will occur, and a Statement of Matters Asserted, which lays out the allegations against the respondent.  The Notice of Hearing generally includes additional rules specific to that agency or that administrative law judge. </p>
<p>For example, some agencies require the respondent to provide an answer within thirty days of receiving the Notice of Hearing.  Failure to provide the answer can lead to default, or automatic loss of the hearing.  Additionally, some judges require the parties to exchange witnesses and exhibits ahead of the hearing, or schedule a pre-trial conference.  For these reasons, it is very important to read the Notice of Hearing carefully. </p>
<h3>Hearing</h3>
<p>The Hearing is held before the ALJ as described above.  The ALJ generally issues a written decision within about six weeks of the hearing.  You can review <a href="https://administrativelawreport.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decisions written before 2018</a> online.</p>
<p>Depending on the agency, that decision may either be a recommendation or the final decision.  If it is a recommendation, then the agency gets to review it, accept it, reject it, or modify it.  The agency then issues a final decision.  If the ALJ’s decision is styled as a Final Decision, then the agency does not get to review it. </p>
<p>Once the respondent receives a final decision, the respondent can appeal it to a superior court.  This is known as a Petition for Judicial Review. </p>
<p>So, while different agencies have different authority over different types of people or different types of violations, the procedure is the same.  Because of Ann’s seven years as an Assistant Attorney General, she has extensive experience with administrative law and can handle any type of case before OSAH.  If you have received correspondence from a state agency regarding an alleged violation, or if you have received a Notice of Hearing from OSAH, please <a href="/contact/">contact Ann</a> to discuss your options.</p>
