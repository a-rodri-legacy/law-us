										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ann specializes in Georgia education and election law. She opened her own firm in Decatur, Georgia in 2014, after serving as a prosecutor and an Assistant Attorney General.  Ann represents primarily teachers, but she also helps students, political candidates, local boards of election, and other people with education or election law issues.  Ann’s mother was a teacher and she knows how hard teachers work, how seriously they take their jobs, and how challenging their problems can be.  Ann has found that the same qualities apply to those involved in the electoral process.</p>
<p>Ann knows that no two clients are the same, and even clients with similar cases may, for various personal or financial reasons, choose different legal strategies.  That is why Ann takes the time to listen to her clients, to answer their questions, and to provide a range of possible strategies.  Once the strategic decisions have been made, Ann switches from listening to fighting.  Whether it is in the courtroom or through settlement negotiations, Ann pursues the best possible outcome for her clients. </p>
<p>Ann has over twenty years of courtroom experience.  As a criminal prosecutor, Ann served as lead attorney in over twenty-five jury trials as well as numerous bench trials, motions, and criminal appeals.  As an Assistant Attorney General from 2005-2012, Ann represented the Professional Standards Commission and the State Election Board at the Office of State Administrative Hearings and in the Georgia Court of Appeals, the Georgia Supreme Court, and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. </p>
<p>Since opening her own firm, Ann</p>
<ul>
<li>Has obtained favorable decisions in Fair Dismissal Acts hearings, saving teacher’s jobs.</li>
<li>Has successfully defended teachers in hearings against the Professional Standards Commission, preserving their professional certificates.</li>
<li>Won a favorable verdict from the Georgia Supreme Court in an election contest dispute, Dawkins-Haigler v. Anderson.</li>
<li>Often negotiates very favorable settlements, as judges and opposing counsel know and expect that Ann will come prepared, organized, and passionate about her client’s case.</li>
</ul>

Fortunately, she still has her dog Hercules who not only takes her on walks but also patiently poses for pictures.  She sits on the Board of the Georgia Association of Women Lawyers and Camp Kudzu, which serves teens and children living with Type 1 diabetes.  Ann received a B.A. from the College of William &amp; Mary and a J.D. from the University of Michigan.  Go Blue!</p>
